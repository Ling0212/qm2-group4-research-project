# Limitations

*“Reflection on context*

*Essential elements: We expect to see some discussion of collection methodology, controversy and/or quality of the data.*

*For higher marks, we would want to see a reflection on the potential impacts of your analysis and on the position of your group’s research in a wider academic or popular debate.”*

-the use of indicators: we only selected three dimensions to measure social wellbeing + the limitations of HDI conception, the other aspects like inequalities or poverty-related dimensions are not considered in our research

# Highlight our important research findings
+ combine all the findings from "Data analysis and Visualization" and "Complementary investigation" sections, especially draw upon the similarities and differences between findings on Lebaon data and those on Jordan data
"But..."
+ research outcomes in relation to policy suggestions (pay attention to the wording, use the phrases like could be, can be...)
+ situate our research in the wider research context, relate our research findings to previous research findings and relevant quantitative techniques used on this subject matter if any
