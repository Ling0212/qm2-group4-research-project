## Conclusion

To conclude, electricity generation is more correlated with Lebanese wellbeing than total energy supply. Our hypothesis is not fully validated given the obscure relationships between some of our variables. While electricity generation per capita shows a verified relationship with the components of standard of living and health, it is not the case for education. The relationship between total energy supply per capita and each of the variables representing the wellbeing of the Lebanese cannot be discernible. Thus, our first research objective, exploring the correlation, has been met and only allows us to validate part of our hypothesis. We have also achieved our second objective by establishing a meaningful comparison with Jordan. 

While this project allows us to establish quantitative links between electricity generation in Lebanon and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, it does not allow us to assert an irrefutable relationship. Also, it is impossible for us to say from our research that if the electricity generation per capita increases, the variables related to the welfare of Lebanese will also increase by causation. For this reason, we recommend further investigation of the issue, however, it is already possible to state that measures implemented by the government would be beneficial from an economic as well as social point of view.
