# CORRELOGRAMS IN PYTHON
# We first import and read the using pandas data we intend to plot in a correlogram, stored in a .csv file.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pd.read_csv('lebanon_data.csv', delimiter=',')

# With pandas, we have here imported and read Lebanon's data saved as a .csv file. For Jordan's data, we store it in a csv file and then read it in the same manner.

# Working with matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries, we now plot the correlogram thanks to the following lines of code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

data=pd.read_csv('lebanon_data.csv', delimiter=',')

sns.pairplot(data, kind='reg', diag_kind='kde', height=5)
plt.show()

# In order to simplify the code, we choose to name the data included in the .csv file 'data'.
