# KENDALL RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT IN PYTHON
# We ground ourselves on the definition of the Kendall-τ, in order to create the lines of code that will compute this coefficient. This τ is defined as:

τ = [(number of concordant pairs) - (number of dicordant pairs)] / [n(n - 1)/2]

# We say the pair (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is concordant when i < j if, xi < xj and yi < yj. In the same way, this pair is concordant when i > j if, xi > xj and yi > yj. Otherwise, the pair is defined as discordant.

# The following lines of code allow to compute the value of the Kendall-τ, previously defined:
