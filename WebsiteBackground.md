# Literature Review
A lot of academic research has been previously done on this subject matter, with quite a few qualitative analysis concerning energy crisis and frequent blackouts in Lebanon. Dagher and Yacoubian (2012) have adopted an approach from an economics perspective by employing causality tests to explore the energy-GDP nexus for Lebanon, and found that a bidirectional relationship exists between the two both in the short-run and in the long-run, more specifically, energy access problem has limited economic growth in Lebanon.    The work by Lanier (2020) has evaluated the sustainability of Lebanese electricity system and highlighted the destruction of quality of life. It predicts the energy deficit to even keep growing because of various economic and social factors. 

While much literature has focused on classical economic analysis (Moore & Collins, 2020), arguably, the economic indicators may not fully reflect the quality of life or living standards of local residents. Controversially, the news once reported that Lebanon was “classified among countries with ‘high human development’ in UNDP’s Human Development Report with an index score of 0.744” (Economic Insights, 2020) and that it had a relatively high Social Progress Index. A social dimension is lacked and should be incorporated instead to give us a more holistic understanding of the problem. Our research project is especially inspired by this paper of Moore and Collins (2020) - which directly pointed out that “a reliable energy supply would improve the wellbeing… for residents of Lebanon”, and more importantly, calls on “policy recognition and research into the entanglement of energy provision shaping people’s lives”.

# Problem Definition
Based on this literature review, to further corroborate or testify the existing narratives, a more quantitative approach to this subject is required, where lies our research, aiming to fill such a literature gap and to implement the knowledge base in this field. Our research question is, therefore, developed, that is - Is there any relationship between energy supply and social wellbeing (measured by economic performance and human development) in Lebanese society from 1990 to 2019 and how might any relationship be explained?
* Originally, we intended to carry out research on the past fifty years’ data, but later depending on the open data available online, the research timeframe is adjusted and narrowed down to the 29-years duration from 1990 to 2019. 

# Our Aims/Motivations
1. to further corroborate and testify the existing narratives, aiming to fill such a research gap & implement the knowledge base in this field
2. to quantify the relationship between energy supply and social wellbeing in Lebanon in the past years from a multi-dimensional data science perspective
3. to enhance the understanding on this current affair, more specifically, how might the energy crisis or power outages have affected the social welfare sensed by the residents in Lebanon
4. to verify whether energy-related matters deserve substantial consideration in governmental policies 

# Our Objectives
# Generally, our project can be divided into two research stages with a focus on primary investigation. 
1. Primary investigation
Explore any possible correlation/relationship between total energy supply per capita and the variables we selected to measure human development.
2. Secondary investigation (Complementary investigation)
We are curious to see if any identified relationship is unique to Lebanon only. We acknowledged that Jordan may be one similar, comparable Middle Eastern country to Lebanon in this case, given that Jordan is also reported to have suffered from energy crisis (with heavy reliance on imported sources to meet its energy needs and failure to develop domestic sources of energy in the past decades; escalating energy bills and electricity costs (Power Technology, 2018); governmental transparency and corruption as major obstacles to energy reform) (Whitman, 2015).
* Perform the same data science and visualisation techniques on the data collected for Jordan. 
* Discuss and compare the research findings obtained from two research stages.

# Hypothesis
Here is what we expect to find during this project:
1. There is a correlation between the shortage of energy supply and human development in Lebanon from 1990 to 2019.
2. The identified relationship for Lebanon is similar to that of Jordan.
